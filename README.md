# Noqx-JS

Pure Javascript implementation of [Noqx](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx).

## Differences between Noqx

### Code conversions

The converted codes are pre-generated by Copilot with manual modifications, and some variables are renamed to avoid conflict:

- `Color` -> `BaseColor`

- `Direction` -> `BaseDir`

- `Point` -> `BasePoint`

- `Puzzle` -> `PenpaPuzzle` (which extends `BasePuzzle`)

### Data structure conversions

According to the difference between `Python` and `Javascript`, the `BasePoint` data structure adds a `toString` function to serialize the data:

```js
class BasePoint {
  constructor(r, c, d = BaseDir.CENTER, pos = "normal") {
    this.r = r;
    this.c = c;
    this.d = d;
    this.pos = pos;
  }

  toString() {
    return `${this.r},${this.c},${this.d.description},${this.pos}`;
  }
}
```

Therefore, all the keys of `surface`, `text`, `symbol`, `edge` and `line` are changed to a `String` object in the `Javascript` version.
