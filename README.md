# Noqx-JS

Pure Javascript implementation of [Noqx](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/noqx).

## Conversion from Python

The codes are pre-generated by Copilot, and some variables are renamed to avoid conflict:

- `Color` -> `BaseColor`

- `Direction` -> `BaseDir`

- `Point` -> `BasePoint`

- `Puzzle` -> `PenpaPuzzle` (which extends `BasePuzzle`)

Moreover, the API of every rule is not changed.
